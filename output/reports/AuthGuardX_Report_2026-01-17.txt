Author: vedant
Date: 2026-01-17

1. Introduction
This project demonstrates password attack simulations and security auditing.

2. Modules Implemented
- Dictionary Generator: yes
- Password Strength Analyzer: yes
- Brute Force Simulator: yes
- Hash Type Identifier: yes

3. Observations
Weak passwords are easily guessable.
Strong passwords have higher entropy and complexity.
Brute force attacks take time depending on complexity.

4. Conclusion
Strong password policies and secure hashing are essential.

5. Future Scope
- Add real-time monitoring
- Integrate with SIEM
- Add GUI
